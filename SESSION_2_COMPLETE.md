### **Interactive Flow Examples**

#### **Safety Check Step**
```
🛡️ Safety Check
Before we begin troubleshooting your Pizza Prep Counter PPC 410, let's ensure it's safe to proceed.

Instructions:
• Ensure the equipment is accessible and the area is clear
• Check that you have adequate lighting to see clearly
• Make sure no food is currently being processed

⚠️ Important Warnings:
• Never attempt repairs on equipment that is still connected to power
• If you smell gas or see sparks, stop immediately and call for help

[✅ Area is safe to proceed] [⚠️ Need to secure area first] [🚨 Safety concern detected]
```

#### **Visual Inspection Step**
```
👀 External Visual Inspection  
Let's examine the external condition of your Pizza Prep Counter PPC 410 for obvious issues.

Instructions:
• Look for any visible damage to the exterior panels or casing
• Check all cables and connections for damage or looseness
• Inspect the power cord and plug for any damage

[✅ Everything looks normal] [⚠️ Found some issues] [🔍 Need more specific guidance]

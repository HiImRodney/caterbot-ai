## 🔒 **PRIVACY-COMPLIANT EQUIPMENT INTELLIGENCE**

### **Equipment Intelligence Panel** (Replaces Live Sessions Panel)

**Business Objectives Achieved:**
- ✅ Equipment performance monitoring
- ✅ Pattern learning for AI improvement
- ✅ API abuse detection
- ✅ Cost optimization insights
- ✅ **FULL GDPR COMPLIANCE**

### **Analytics Implementation**

**1. Equipment Performance Monitoring**
```typescript
interface EquipmentAnalytics {
  equipmentId: string;
  issueFrequency: {
    last7Days: number;
    last30Days: number;
    trend: 'increasing' | 'stable' | 'decreasing';
  };
  commonKeywords: string[]; // Anonymized extraction
  resolutionPatterns: {
    patternMatched: number;   // £0 cost
    aiEscalated: number;      // £X cost
    engineerCalled: number;   // £XX cost
  };
  costImpact: string;
}
```

**2. Pattern Learning (Anonymized)**
```typescript
interface PatternAnalytics {
  emergingPhrases: {
    phrase: string;
    frequency: number;
    equipment: string;
  }[];
  frustrationIndicators: {
    urgentLanguage: number;    // "emergency", "urgent", "broken"
    repeatIssues: number;      // Same equipment, similar timeframe
    escalationTriggers: number; // Keywords that predict AI escalation
  };
}
```

**3. API Abuse Detection**
```typescript
interface UsageMonitoring {
  siteId: string; // Site-level only, no individual tracking
  apiMetrics: {
    totalCalls: number;
    averagePerDay: number;
    peakHours: string;
    unusualPatterns: {
      alert: string;
      count: number;
      timeframe: string;
      equipment: string;
    }[];
  };
  costOptimization: {
    patternMatchSavings: string;
    escalationCosts: string;
    totalROI: string;
  };
}
```
